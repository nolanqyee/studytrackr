StudyTrackr is a web app designed to keep you more productive. Over the summer of 2022, its creator, Nolan Yee, conducted research to test whether tracking time had any effect on productivity for students. Time-tracking, in fact, can boost studying efficiency while holding students accountable for the time they spend to complete tasks.
